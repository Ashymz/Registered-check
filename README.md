# Login System with Email and Password

This is a simple login system that allows users to log in using their email and password. The system stores the user data (email and password) in the browser's local storage and retrieves it when the user logs in. If the user's email and password match the stored data, the user is redirected to the edit.html page, where they can edit their profile. Otherwise, an error message is displayed.

The login system uses the following technologies:

- HTML and CSS for the user interface
- JavaScript for the logic and interactivity
- SweetAlert library for displaying error and success messages
- Loader image for showing loading progress

## Getting Started

To use the login system, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The login form will be displayed, and you can enter your email and password to log in. If you're using the system for the first time, you can create a user by clicking on the "Create a new account" button.

## Prerequisites

You need a web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) to use the login system. No other software or tools are required.

## Installation

To install the login system, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by clicking on the green "Code" button on the repository page and selecting "Download ZIP" or "Open with GitHub Desktop", or by running the following command in your terminal:
